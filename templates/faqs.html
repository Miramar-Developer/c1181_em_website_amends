			 <!-- begin of FAQ 1 -->
                        <div class="faq-question">
                          <p>&nbsp;Is coaching the same as counselling?</p></div>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p> No. Counselling tends to look at the past in order to examine and resolve issues affecting the present. Whilst coaching can look to the past, it is future orientated. Coaching focuses on setting goals and forming a plan of action towards achieving them.</p>

                        <div class="faq-question">What sort of things can coaching help with?</div>
                        <div class="faq-answer">
                        <p>Absolutely anything that is relevant to you and your life. You are in control of the topics you bring to coaching. I am in control of guiding you towards achieving your goal by ensuring manageable steps. Some examples of topics clients have brought to me are: improving confidence, getting fit, weight loss, changing jobs, becoming more assertive, time management and starting a business.</p>
