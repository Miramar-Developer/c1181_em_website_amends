		<p><i>Coaching is future orientated taking you from where you are now to where you want to be.</i></p>
		<p>We can get stuck with life, work or family and arenâ€™t sure how to move forward. Coaching is a supportive relationship, which helps you define what you want (your outcome), create a plan and start to take those crucial steps towards ultimately achieving your goal.</p>
		<h3>How can coaching help you?</h3>
		<ul class="list">
			<li>Coaching will help you take a step back and define what you really want.</li>
			<li>Coaching is non-judgmental and completely confidential.</li>
			<li>There is no advice! You are the only person who knows what you want and how to go about achieving it. This is a distraction free, safe environment where you can decide</li>
			<li>Coaching can reshape your whole outlook on life improving relationships at home, work and with friends.</li>
